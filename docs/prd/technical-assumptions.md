# Technical Assumptions

- **Repository Structure**: A polyrepo structure within a single GitHub repository, with top-level frontend and backend directories.

- **Service Architecture**: A serverless architecture. The frontend will be a Next.js app, and the backend will be a separate server application (e.g., using Express or another Next.js app).

- **AI Framework**: BAML will define AI functions. LangGraph will manage the agent's conversational state.

- **Testing**: Jest will be used for unit tests.
