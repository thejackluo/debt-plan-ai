# User Interface Design Goals

- **UI Library**: The interface will be built using the @nlux/react library to ensure a high-quality, beautiful, and simple user experience out of the box.

- **Layout**: A two-panel layout. The left panel shows the list of conversation histories, and the main panel shows the active chat.

- **Functionality**: The UI must include a text input, a send button, and a "Delete History" button that clears the conversation from both the UI and the backend history.json file.

- **Target Device and Platforms**: Desktop-first. Full responsiveness is not required for this assignment.
