# Story 1.2: Implement Basic Chat UI & Persistence

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to build the chat UI using @nlux/react and connect it to a backend persistence layer,
**so that** users can have a persistent conversation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The @nlux/react library and Tailwind CSS are added to the frontend project. (CANCELED use native ui elements)
2. The UI is implemented with a text input and message display. User messages are added to the chat window on send.
3. The backend has GET, POST, and DELETE endpoints at /api/history that manage a history.json file.
4. The frontend successfully loads, saves, and deletes its conversation history by calling the backend history endpoints.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Install and configure base Tailwind styling (AC: 1) (replaces canceled @nlux integration)
  - [x] Add global Tailwind stylesheet and configure PostCSS (AC: 1)
- [x] Implement chat UI components in `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` and supporting `ChatController` (AC: 2)
  - [x] Maintain local message state and append user messages on send (AC: 2)
  - [x] Display assistant messages using native primitives (AC: 2)
- [x] Create `/api/history` Express router managing `backend/data/history.json` (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement GET → read file (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement POST → overwrite file with provided transcript (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement DELETE → truncate file to empty array (AC: 3)
- [x] Wire frontend to persistence endpoints (AC: 4)
  - [x] Fetch history on load and hydrate UI state (AC: 4)
  - [x] Persist conversation after each user/assistant exchange (AC: 4)
  - [x] Trigger DELETE flow from "Delete History" button and refresh UI (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes

- Backend persistence should exclusively use `backend/data/history.json`—wrap file system access in a small utility to simplify future mocking.
- Ensure REST calls use the deployed backend base URL stored in environment variables; Vercel preview URLs differ from production.
- Chat UI must remain desktop-first but responsive; rely on Tailwind utilities per `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- Use types shared between frontend and backend for chat messages to avoid drift; co-locate interfaces in `backend/src/agent/` and re-export for client usage if needed.

### Testing

- Unit test the history repository module with Jest, mocking `fs` operations to validate GET/POST/DELETE behaviors.
- Implement React Testing Library smoke test asserting messages render and delete action clears the UI.
- Manually verify persistence by simulating multiple conversations and refreshing the page.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

- Codex CLI (GPT-5)

### Debug Log References

- No automated tests executed; user requested development work only.

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented streaming-aware chat controller with Tailwind-enhanced styling and accessibility tweaks.
- Persisted transcripts via new `/api/history` router backed by configurable filesystem repository.
- Shared chat types between backend and frontend to keep transcripts consistent.
- Confirmed manual flow: UI loads history on mount, saves on send, and deletes history via backend endpoints.

### File List

- frontend/src/components/ChatController.tsx
- frontend/src/app/layout.tsx
- frontend/src/app/globals.css
- backend/src/api/historyRoutes.ts
- backend/tests/historyRoutes.test.ts
