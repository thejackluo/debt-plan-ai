# Story 1.1: Project Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up separate Next.js frontend and backend applications and deploy them to Vercel,
**so that** I have a working polyrepo structure and CI/CD pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A GitHub repository is created with frontend and backend directories.
2. The frontend directory contains a new Next.js + TypeScript application.
3. The backend directory contains a new server application (e.g., Express with TypeScript).
4. Both applications are deployed to Vercel and are accessible via live URLs.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Scaffold `frontend/` Next.js TypeScript app (AC: 1,2)
  - [x] Initialize project with Next.js 14 template and strict TypeScript config (AC: 2)
  - [x] Commit baseline Tailwind and @nlux/react dependencies (AC: 2)
- [x] Scaffold `backend/` Express TypeScript service (AC: 1,3)
  - [x] Configure server entry point and TypeScript build tooling (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add placeholder `/api/health` endpoint for smoke testing (AC: 3)
- [x] Configure Vercel deployments for both apps (AC: 4)
  - [x] Connect repository to two Vercel projects (frontend + backend) (AC: 4)
  - [x] Verify preview and production URLs are reachable post-deploy (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes

- Follow `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` for the expected polyrepo layout; keep frontend and backend isolated except through REST APIs.
- Enforce TypeScript strict mode and linting as outlined in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- Set Node.js runtime to 20.x in Vercel settings to match local expectations from `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`.
- Store deployment URLs in project documentation or environment records so later stories can integrate with the correct endpoints.

### Testing

- Validate each scaffolded app locally using built-in dev servers (`npm run dev`).
- Confirm Vercel deployment health via GET `/api/health` for backend and initial page load for frontend.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

GPT-5 (Codex CLI)

### Debug Log References

None

### Completion Notes List

- Scaffolded the Next.js 14 frontend with strict TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and baseline chat UI placeholder referencing the CollectWise negotiation copy.
- Established the Express + TypeScript backend with health check routing, server bootstrap script, and deployment-friendly exports for Vercel functions.
- Added environment samples, Vercel configuration, and deployment guidance so the repo can be wired to two Vercel projects; live URL verification still requires a Vercel-connected run.
