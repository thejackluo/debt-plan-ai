# Story 1.3: Scalable OpenAI API Endpoint

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a well-structured and documented backend endpoint that connects to OpenAI,
**so that** I have a scalable foundation for the AI agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A /api/chat endpoint is created in the backend application.
2. The endpoint is well-documented using comments (e.g., JSDoc).
3. It takes a conversation history and proxies the request to the OpenAI API via the Vercel AI SDK.
4. The frontend sends its conversation to this endpoint and displays the streamed response.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add `/api/chat` router with POST handler receiving `{ messages: Message[] }` (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Validate request payload shape and return 400 on invalid input (AC: 1)
- [ ] Integrate Vercel AI SDK client in backend service layer (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Stream OpenAI responses back through Express response (AC: 3,4)
  - [ ] Ensure API keys are resolved from environment variables with fallbacks for local dev (AC: 3)
- [ ] Document endpoint with JSDoc and README snippet (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Include request/response examples and error cases (AC: 2)
- [ ] Update frontend to call `/api/chat` for assistant responses (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Handle streaming updates in UI and reconcile with persistence logic (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
- Reuse chat message interfaces defined during Story 1.2; keep them in a shared TypeScript module to avoid duplication.
- Follow `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` guidance when configuring the Vercel AI SDK and ensure compatibility with Node 20 serverless runtime.
- Include exponential backoff or retry strategy for transient OpenAI errors to improve resilience.
- Keep logs structured; capture request IDs to aid debugging as specified in `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`.

### Testing
- Add Jest tests covering payload validation and mocked OpenAI responses (use SDK mocks to simulate stream).
- Include integration test exercising `/api/chat` with supertest to confirm 200 responses and error branches.
- Execute manual end-to-end test from frontend to verify streamed content renders and persists correctly.
